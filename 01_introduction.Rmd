# Introduction

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:02:32	Abdou: Hello
00:02:39	Keuntae Kim: Good morning
00:02:44	Muhammed Ceesay: Hi
00:03:34	Abdou: Okay, I guess we could start
00:03:47	Keuntae Kim: good
00:04:12	Muhammed Ceesay: Yes We Can.

I can hear you
00:04:23	Keuntae Kim: I can hear you, too.
00:04:32	Keuntae Kim: I think we are good to go.
00:08:48	Keuntae Kim: Okay.
00:09:52	Keuntae Kim: I can see the screenshot.
00:18:10	Gus Lipkin: https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/index.html
00:23:20	Keuntae Kim: Run the "nrow(available.packages(repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org"))"
00:23:46	Keuntae Kim: The number is different when you run this online and when you run it in RStudio
00:25:05	Keuntae Kim: Online: 14393 RStudio: 19196. Which one is correct?
00:26:48	Gus Lipkin: They might be using different repositories. The 19196 I think is even lower than total

CRAN themselves say 19223: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/
00:27:55	Keuntae Kim: Got it. Maybe a different version of R embedded into the book. Thank you.
00:28:09	Keuntae Kim: We need to decide who will do the next chapter next week.
00:29:36	Keuntae Kim: Then, let's do 2.1 for one week and 2.2 for the next.
00:30:02	Keuntae Kim: Chapter 2 is dense and includes a lot of math. theories, so we need to study deeper.
00:30:41	Keuntae Kim: Abdou, you do chapter 2.1 next week and I will do 2.2 two weeks later.
00:32:17	Keuntae Kim: See you all next week. Bye.
