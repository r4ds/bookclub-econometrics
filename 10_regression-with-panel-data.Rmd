# Regression with Panel Data

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:18:09	Abdou:	Since all variables are observed for all entities and over all time periods, the panel is balanced. If there were missing data for at least one entity in at least one time period we would call the panel unbalanced.
00:19:42	Abdou:	Can we say that the ‚Äúzero conditional mean‚Äù assumption is violated in this case?
00:23:54	Abdou:	But this is different from a ‚Äúdifference in difference‚Äù method, right?
00:28:22	Abdou:	Thanks!
00:30:12	Abdou:	Sorry, if I get it right is it the ‚Äústate‚Äù that is fixed or some unobserved factors in the state?
00:34:26	Abdou:	Okay, thanks!
00:41:24	Abdou:	If we use time fixed effects, we assume that each year has a different baseline level of traffic fatality rate that is independent of the beer tax variable. By including time fixed effects, we can compare the effect of beer tax across different states within each year, while holding constant the year-specific factors.
00:41:37	Abdou:	Not sure if this helps?
00:49:07	Abdou:	Our results are bias, right?
00:49:21	Abdou:	Omitted variables problem
