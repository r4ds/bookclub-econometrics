# Hypothesis Tests and Confidence Intervals in Multiple Regression

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:10:23	Abdou:	Sure, we did!
00:18:15	Abdou:	"pt" implies "probability distribution function for the Student's t-distribution". It is used to calculate the p-value of a two-sided test.
00:30:01	Abdou:	Why canâ€™t we just test the coefficients one at a time? Instead of doing a joint test.
01:10:14	Abdou:	How large does the # observation has to be for F-distribution to approximate the chi-square/q?
01:12:45	Abdou:	Thanks!
