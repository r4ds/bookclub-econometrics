# A Review of Statistics using R

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:22:30	Keuntae Kim: This is because we only have one parameter.
00:22:38	Keuntae Kim: What if we have two?
00:22:50	Keuntae Kim: It would be a 3-dimensional parabolic space
00:24:54	Keuntae Kim: Sometimes, we might need purposive sampling.
00:25:36	Abdou: Maybe explain it better?
00:25:44	Keuntae Kim: Meaning that we intentionally collect the sample for a specific purpose
00:25:59	Keuntae Kim: focusing on a specific group, not general population
00:26:25	Keuntae Kim: No, in that case, we might need to have some good rationales or theories behind that sampling process.
00:27:06	Keuntae Kim: , which means there are many real-world cases that we might not have random sampling
00:27:12	Keuntae Kim: even if we think it is.
00:28:19	Keuntae Kim: That might be the case, but sometimes we might look at the over-65 years old population from the entire population.
00:28:41	Abdou: Sure, you right
00:28:53	Keuntae Kim: Anyway, what I would like to say is that in the real-world practice, it would be quite difficult to define what random sampling is.
00:29:25	Keuntae Kim: We sometimes just assume that we draw the sample randomly.
00:29:54	Abdou: Yeah for now lets assume like that
00:30:18	Keuntae Kim: Okay. go ahead. Sorry to interrupt too much.
00:30:53	Abdou: Not really, this was quite useful!

00:01:25	Abdou: hI Kim
00:22:17	Abdou: If we donâ€™t reject the null is it the same as saying we accept it?
00:39:49	Abdou: Cmd + Shift + M for %>% or |> in R
00:42:28	Abdou: clear
