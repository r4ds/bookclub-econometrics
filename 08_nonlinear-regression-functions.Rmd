# Nonlinear Regression Functions

**Learning objectives:**

- THESE ARE NICE TO HAVE BUT NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

## SLIDE 1

- ADD SLIDES AS SECTIONS (`##`).
- TRY TO KEEP THEM RELATIVELY SLIDE-LIKE; THESE ARE NOTES, NOT THE BOOK ITSELF.

## Meeting Videos

### Cohort 1

00:09:52	Abdou:	Sure, that sounds good!
00:26:12	Abdou:	Are their test to determine the presence of non-linearity in our regression model?
00:27:19	Abdou:	Or should we just look for the presence of polynomials, logs, products etcâ€¦
00:42:01	Abdou:	Awesome, the matrix visualizations makes it really interesting
